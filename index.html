        <p>The <b>1000 skulltula</b>  is found in that area after killing <i>1000</i>  enemies. The <b>piece of heart</b>  is gotten by <i>capturing that keep</i>  and the <b>heart container</b> requiers<i> bombs</i>. The<b> hard Skulltula </b>can only be gotten by<i> beating the game and then playing this stage again with the hylian sword and using the fairy fountain.</i></p>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Destroy the enemies in front of you.</li>
          <br>
          <li>After a little while, you'll automatically meet and pick up your fairy companion, Proxi. She speaks for you because god forbid Link speaks in any game he's in.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Keep destroying enemies and eventually the doors to the Abaandoned Fort will open.</li>
        <br>
            <li>Enter the Abandoned Fort and battle Volga.
        <br>
            Lock on to Volga with the L Button and circle around him until he performs an attack that leaves him vulnerable (you'll see a Weak Point gauge above his head). That's your queue to start attacking him. The more you attack, the more segments of the gauge will disappear. When all the segments are gone, you'll deliver a powerful blow that will take off a good chunk off of the enemy's life bar. More likely than not you'll kill the enemy in one use of this.</li>
        <br>
            <li>Once Volga's down, head north out of the Abandoned Fort and fight the Lizalfos harassing the Goron Captain. Similar to Volga, lock on and circle around him until he breaths fire. Once he's done, his Weak Point gauge will appear. Kill him!</li>
        <br>
            <li>After that,the Goron Captain will open the mine for you. Head on in and collect the Bombs from the treasure chest.</li>
        <br>
            <li>Use your new toy to bomb your way out of the cave.</li>
        <br>
              <ul>
                <li>There's another boulder right outside. Bomb it and you'll find a treasure chest full of Rupees.</li>
              </ul>
              </ol>

              <br>
              <li>Head south back through the Abandoned Fort and blow up the rocks blocking the entrance to West Field Keep. Capture the keep if you like (defeat enough enemies and the Keep Boss will appear. Take out the Keep Boss and the keep is yours!) Head east and Zelda will tell you what to do.</li>
              <li>The keeps she wants captured are the one in the center of the map and the one on the far right, towards the top.When both keeps are captured, head down to the Fairy Fountain in the lower right and bomb your way through the front door. Once Zelda shows up, she'll activate the magic circle. Stand in the center and press the Y Button.</li>
          <br>
              <li>The Great Fairy will appear and bomb the snot out of the enemy forces. Even better, you'll get the credit for the 500 or so enemies she takes out.That tends to destroy all enemies in the enemy territory past the central keep.</li>
          <br>
              <li>Avoid the Dodongo until it opens its yap and starts inhaling.</li></p>

          <p> That's when you throw bomb in its mouth. Once you do, it will fall over and its Weak Point gauge will appear. Smack the crap out of it until you deplete the gauge.Ideally you will want to use your special. It may take a full two rounds of bombs to fully deplete its gauge. Once you do, you'll deliver an attack that will cause a great deal of damage. This will kill the Dodongo.

        <p>After that you move on to the second stage, Eldin Caves - The Sheikah Tribesman</p>
        <img class="bob" src="http://zeldawiki.org/images/e/e7/Eldin_Caves_map.jpg">
        <p>To get the Heart Container with Impa you must bomb the boulder near the stage's exit. To get the Heart Piece for link you must Capture the Crystal Cave. To get the Magic Rod for  Link (weapon) you must Capture Tunnel Square.</p>
        <p>Skulltula - KO 1000 enemies and you'll find it just outside Stone Square to the southeast. Skulltula - After beating Ganon's Tower - Liberation of the Triforce, replay this level on Hard, using Impa equipped with the Giant Blade. Defeat Wizzro without allowing a Bombchu to be destroyed while also keeping Sheik safe.</p>
        <p>The Crystal Cave will unlock shortly after you capture the Tunnel Square.  Make sure you Capture the Crystal Cave before or immediately after you go after the Spirt of the Caves.  Towards the end of the level, once the final Bombchu has a clear path to the stone spire, run up to Crystal Cave.  Exit north from Crystal Cave and follow the path to the end.  Switch to your Hookshot and use it to mount the ledge where you'll find the Skulltula.</p>
        <p>The Victory Conditions are; Impa and Link escape. The Defeat Conditions are; Link flees or either of the Bombchus in the second escort mission are destroyed.</p>
        <p>Quickly head northeast from the start and you'll find a cracked wall. Chuck a bomb at it to knock it down.  Run straight ahead, hang a right and run down towards the South Square.  You'll meet up with the Hylian Captain in a minute or two.  First, you better do something about all those darn monsters! Capture South Square as quickly as you can.  When you're done, run back the way you came and capture the Stone Square.  This will stem the flow of monsters and raise your team's morale.  Now, head north and take your first left. You'll find the Hylian Captain being harassed by a Big Poe. Lend the man a hand and take it out for him.</p>
        <p>Head back to the start of the stage and meet up with the Bombchu. Follow it to its destination and smack any monster that dares get near it. Don't worry about setting off the Bombchu, it's immune to your attacks.</p>
        <p>The Bombchu will stop at the entrance to the West Square.  Run inside and capture it. Once you're done, the Bombchu will advance to the stone spire and blow it up. This will create a new path, allowing you to continue forward. Head north from the West Square and meet up with Link. Oh look, it's Sheik! For those who don't know, Sheik is actually Zelda. No duh.</p>
        <p>Head east and follow the tunnel to Tunnel Square. Capture Tunnel Square and a chest will appear. Open it up and claim the Magic Rod for Link.</p>
        <p>Head due east out of Tunnel Square once the door opens and head down the tunnel (don't worry, the gate will open shortly after you capture Tunnel Square). Follow it around until you find the Big Poe marked as the Spirit of the Caves. Take it down.</p>
        <p>Head out of the cave and back to Tunnel Square. The south door is now open so head inside and you'll see another Bombchu. Time to find one more. Head due south and jump off the ledge. You'll land in the Central Square. Capture it.</p>
        <p>Head to the southernmost Bombchu and fight off the horde of enemies approaching.  Focus on the enemies with health bars like Lizalfos.</p>
