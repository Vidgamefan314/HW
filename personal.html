      <p>The <b>1000 skulltula</b>  is found in that area after killing <i>1000</i>  enemies. The <b>piece of heart</b>  is gotten by <i>capturing that keep</i>  and the <b>heart container</b> requiers<i> bombs</i>. The<b> hard Skulltula </b>can only be gotten by<i> beating the game and then playing this stage again with the hylian sword and using the fairy fountain.</i></p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><p>Destroy the enemies in front of you.</li>
        <li>After a little while, you'll automatically meet and pick up your fairy companion, Proxi. She speaks for you because god forbid Link speaks in any game he's in.</li>
        <li>Keep destroying enemies and eventually the doors to the Abaandoned Fort will open.</li>
        <br>
          <li>Enter the Abandoned Fort and battle Volga.<br>
          Lock on to Volga with the L Button and circle around him until he performs an attack that leaves him vulnerable (you'll see a Weak Point gauge above his head). That's your queue to start attacking him. The more you attack, the more segments of the gauge will disappear. When all the segments are gone, you'll deliver a powerful blow that will take off a good chunk off of the enemy's life bar. More likely than not you'll kill the enemy in one use of this.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Once Volga's down, head north out of the Abandoned Fort and fight the Lizalfos harassing the Goron Captain. Similar to Volga, lock on and circle around him until he breaths fire. Once he's done, his Weak Point gauge will appear. Kill him!</li>
          <br>
          <li>After that,the Goron Captain will open the mine for you. Head on in and collect the Bombs from the treasure chest.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Use your new toy to bomb your way out of the cave.</li>
          <br>
            <ul>
              <li>There's another boulder right outside. Bomb it and you'll find a treasure chest full of Rupees.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Head south back through the Abandoned Fort and blow up the rocks blocking the entrance to West Field Keep. Capture the keep if you like (defeat enough enemies and the Keep Boss will appear. Take out the Keep Boss and the keep is yours!) Head east and Zelda will tell you what to do.</li>
            <li>The keeps she wants captured are the one in the center of the map and the one on the far right, towards the top.When both keeps are captured, head down to the Fairy Fountain in the lower right and bomb your way through the front door. Once Zelda shows up, she'll activate the magic circle. Stand in the center and press the Y Button.</li><br>
            <li>The Great Fairy will appear and bomb the snot out of the enemy forces. Even better, you'll get the credit for the 500 or so enemies she takes out.That tends to destroy all enemies in the enemy territory past the central keep.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Avoid the Dodongo until it opens its yap and starts inhaling.</li></p>

        <p> That's when you throw bomb in its mouth. Once you do, it will fall over and its Weak Point gauge will appear. Smack the crap out of it until you deplete the gauge.Ideally you will want to use your special. It may take a full two rounds of bombs to fully deplete its gauge. Once you do, you'll deliver an attack that will cause a great deal of damage. This will kill the Dodongo.
