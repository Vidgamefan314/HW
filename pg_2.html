      <h3>1-1</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        For the A rank you need to complete it in 7 minutes with 10,000 or less damage taken. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> 
      This is a tough one to get done in the required 10 minutes. The battle quickly gets very crazy; in addition to a bunch of Lizalfos and enemy warriors, before long you'll have to deal with four The Imprisoned. You can use any warrior you want but using Link with his Great Fairy is a good choice as it's great at clearing crowds.
      </p>
      <p>There really isn't any trick to this one other than to make sure you're constantly downing enemies. Focus on the minions as you don't have time for the enemy warriors. Also, keep an eye on the positions of The Imprisoned. If you get cornered, you're going to take a lot of damage (plus, you often can't see where you are when The Imprisoned is in the way).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're going for the Heart Container then spam Agitha's Y + Y + X combo. It doesn't matter how much damage you take but you'll want to have as many Zora Tunic Defense Badges as you can so you can concentrate on fighting and not worry so much about healing. Just keep moving and spamming that combo! Remember, you can speed things up by ending Agitha's summon animation early. Just hit the B Button to dash while she's jumping up and down.
      </p>

      <h3>1-2</h3>
      <p>
        For the A rank you need 1,200 KOs, clear it in 15 minutes or less, and take 10,000 damage or less.
      </p>

      <p>To get a skulltula - KO 1,000 enemies and you'll find it on a ledge on the path leading northwest from the W. Boulder Keep. Use the Hookshot to reach it. To get another skulltula - Complete the first mission and KO 1,200 enemies without losing more that 4 Hearts worth of damage and it will appear in the same place as the last one.
      </p>
      <p>This is counter-intuitive but ignore the Bombchu and go after the enemy warriors (mostly Big Icy Poes). Focus on the enemies in the south and work your way to the east. While you're taking out Poes, the Bombchus will take out the W. Mountain Keep and W. Boulder Keep. A third Bombchu will eventually make its way to the Allied Base. By this point, you should have worked your way up to the East Keep. Run over to the Allied Base and destroy the Bombchu before it destroys the Allied Base. Then scour the map for any remaining enemy warriors and take them out. Once they're gone, recapture the W. Boulder Keep and W. Mountain Keep. A Summoner will appear and another Bombchu will make for the Allied Base. Go after the Summoner first then run back and take care of the Bombchu. Mop up any warriors the Summoner added to the battlefield then head to the Enemy Base to defeat Ganondorf.</p>

      <p>Skulltula - KO 1,000 enemies and you'll find it just outside the west entrance of the N. Entrance Keep. Skulltula - Complete the first mission and KO 1,200 enemies without losing more that 4 Hearts worth of damage and it will appear in the same place as the last one.</p>
      <p>Defeat the three enemy captains marked on your map to unlock the Enemy Base so you can battle Sheik. When the mission starts, head to the room in front of the Sacred Pedestal where Cia is and battle Impa. Cia needs to survive and she won't if you let her battle Impa by herself. Once Impa's down, head to the Allied Base and take out any enemy warriors there. Once the Base is safe, track down the third enemy captain (if they hadn't already made their way to the base.</p>
      <p>Once you KO the third marked enemy captain, three Manhandla Stalks will sprout around the battlefield. Take them all out with your Boomerang. If the Allied Base is under attack, head back and take care of the bad guys. Once the base is safe, head to the Enemy Base to battle Sheik.</p>

      <p>To get an a rank you need 1,200 KO's, clear in 15 minutes, and take less than 10,000 damage.</p>

      <p>Use a Bomb Card on the middle of the rock wall to unlock the "A" Rank reward. Princess Parasol (most powerful version of Agitha's Parasol weapon) - "A" Rank reward. Heart Container (Agitha) - Capture the East Field Keep. Heart Piece (Agitha) - Capture the Castle Keep.</p>
      <p>Defeat the three enemy captains marked on your map to unlock the Enemy Base. We recommend starting with Ganondorf as he's not very strong in this scenario and you can take him out before too many Lizalfos surround you. From here on out though it's pretty much going to be all Lizalfos, all the time. Do your best to keep them out of the Allied Base. <br>Once you defeat the three marked enemy captains, three Manhandla Stalks will sprout around the battlefield. Take them out as fast as you can to stop their seed attack on the Allied Base. About this time, Cia will cry for help.  Track her down and heal her and she should be able to hold her own against Zelda while you head to the Enemy Base to defeat Link.  Just make sure there are no enemy warriors in or near the Allied Base before you leave.</p>

      <p>To get a heart pice for fi you need an a rank.</p>
      <p>Defeat the correct enemy in each room. In the first room, defeat Ganondorf. In the second, Zelda. In the third, Link. If you're having difficulty, take the time to chop the grass outside for goodies. If you're lucky, you may go in with a full Special or Magic Gauge.</p>
