      <h3>1-1</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        For the A rank you need to complete it in 7 minutes with 10,000 or less damage taken. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> 
      This is a tough one to get done in the required 10 minutes. The battle quickly gets very crazy; in addition to a bunch of Lizalfos and enemy warriors, before long you'll have to deal with four The Imprisoned. You can use any warrior you want but using Link with his Great Fairy is a good choice as it's great at clearing crowds.
      </p>
      <p>There really isn't any trick to this one other than to make sure you're constantly downing enemies. Focus on the minions as you don't have time for the enemy warriors. Also, keep an eye on the positions of The Imprisoned. If you get cornered, you're going to take a lot of damage (plus, you often can't see where you are when The Imprisoned is in the way).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're going for the Heart Container then spam Agitha's Y + Y + X combo. It doesn't matter how much damage you take but you'll want to have as many Zora Tunic Defense Badges as you can so you can concentrate on fighting and not worry so much about healing. Just keep moving and spamming that combo! Remember, you can speed things up by ending Agitha's summon animation early. Just hit the B Button to dash while she's jumping up and down.
      </p>

      <h3>1-2</h3>
      <p>
        For the A rank you need 1,200 KOs, clear it in 15 minutes or less, and take 10,000 damage or less.

      </p>
      <p>This is counter-intuitive but ignore the Bombchu and go after the enemy warriors (mostly Big Icy Poes). Focus on the enemies in the south and work your way to the east. While you're taking out Poes, the Bombchus will take out the W. Mountain Keep and W. Boulder Keep. A third Bombchu will eventually make its way to the Allied Base. By this point, you should have worked your way up to the East Keep. Run over to the Allied Base and destroy the Bombchu before it destroys the Allied Base. Then scour the map for any remaining enemy warriors and take them out. Once they're gone, recapture the W. Boulder Keep and W. Mountain Keep. A Summoner will appear and another Bombchu will make for the Allied Base. Go after the Summoner first then run back and take care of the Bombchu. Mop up any warriors the Summoner added to the battlefield then head to the Enemy Base to defeat Ganondorf.</p>

      <p>Defeat the three enemy captains marked on your map to unlock the Enemy Base so you can battle Sheik. When the mission starts, head to the room in front of the Sacred Pedestal where Cia is and battle Impa. Cia needs to survive and she won't if you let her battle Impa by herself. Once Impa's down, head to the Allied Base and take out any enemy warriors there. Once the Base is safe, track down the third enemy captain (if they hadn't already made their way to the base.</p>
      <p>Once you KO the third marked enemy captain, three Manhandla Stalks will sprout around the battlefield. Take them all out with your Boomerang. If the Allied Base is under attack, head back and take care of the bad guys. Once the base is safe, head to the Enemy Base to battle Sheik.</p>

      <p>To get an a rank you need 1,200 KO's, clear in 15 minutes, and take less than 10,000 damage.</p>

      <p>Defeat the three enemy captains marked on your map to unlock the Enemy Base. We recommend starting with Ganondorf as he's not very strong in this scenario and you can take him out before too many Lizalfos surround you. From here on out though it's pretty much going to be all Lizalfos, all the time. Do your best to keep them out of the Allied Base. <br>Once you defeat the three marked enemy captains, three Manhandla Stalks will sprout around the battlefield. Take them out as fast as you can to stop their seed attack on the Allied Base. About this time, Cia will cry for help.  Track her down and heal her and she should be able to hold her own against Zelda while you head to the Enemy Base to defeat Link.  Just make sure there are no enemy warriors in or near the Allied Base before you leave.</p>

      <p>To get a heart pice for fi you need an a rank.</p>
      <p>Defeat the correct enemy in each room. In the first room, defeat Ganondorf. In the second, Zelda. In the third, Link. If you're having difficulty, take the time to chop the grass outside for goodies. If you're lucky, you may go in with a full Special or Magic Gauge.</p>
      <a name="1-6"></a>
      <h3>1-6</h3>
      <p>To get an a rank you need 1,200 kills, cleared in 15 minutes or less, and take 10,000 damage or less. </p>
      <p>Use a Bomb Card on the rock formation on the left to unlock the scenario for play. Heart Container (Link) - Capture the W. Rockface Keep. Heart Piece (Link) - Capture the Abandoned Fort.</p>
      <p>Skulltula - KO 1,000 enemies and it'll be on the ledge north of the East Field Keep. Use your Hookshot to reach it. Skulltula - Complete the first mission and KO 1,200 enemies without losing more that 4 Hearts worth of damage and it will appear in the same place as the last one.</p>
      <p>First thing's first, take out the Bombchus. Start with the one near you then go after the one that starts in the east and heads towards the Central Keep. Finally, take out the one in the north by the Enemy Base (it heads for the Allied Base). Now focus your efforts on capturing the Central Keep (if it has fallen) and the Castle Keep. Once both are under your control, a fourth Bombchu will head for the Allied Base. Take it out. Now capture the Fairy Fountain to rescue the Fairy of Darkness and use it to dispel the barrier in the North Field Keep. Capture it to obtain the Boss Key. Use the Boss Key to enter the Enemy Base and defeat Cia. She will summon Ganon. Have you been paying attention to the previous Giant Boss fights? Okay, here's how the first phase of the Ganon fight works. He has four major attacks and each one has to be countered with a different subweapon. Ganon's right gauntlet will glow orange before shooting a large fireball at you. Remember how the Dodongo's mouth glowed orange before you chucked a Bomb in? Do the same thing here.</p>
      <img class="bob" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/hyrule-warriors/f/f4/Tower_11.jpg">
      <img class="bob" id="pl" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/hyrule-warriors/4/43/Tower_13.jpg">
      <p>Ganon will occasionally jump up in the air and breath fire. After that, his tail will briefly glow blue. This is your queue to latch on to it with the Hookshot and yank him out of the sky.</p>
      <p>Before Ganon fires an energy blast out of his left gauntlet, a glowing blue eye is revealed on its surface. Shoot it with your Bow.</p>
      <p>And finally, the spikes on Ganon's shoulders will open and fire seeds just like the Manhandla. When that happens, dodge out of the way and hit it them your Boomerang. You will need to destroy both spikes</p>
      <p>Once you've removed all of Ganon's adornments, the second phase begins.  When the jewel in his head glows, shoot it with an arrow then clobber him while his Weak Point gauge is visible. The jewel will glow after Ganon lunges at you and then spins 180 degrees at the end of his charge.</p>
      <p>His jewel will also glow after he sinks both his hands into the ground and before he does a leaping uppercut. <p>
        
      </p>Defeat Ganon and you've technically beaten Adventure Mode. But you're not going to stop until you've collected everything their is to collect and "A" Ranked every scenario, are you?</p>
      <a name="1-7"></a>
      <h3>1-7</h3>
      <p>To get the A rank you need 1,200 KOs, clear in 15 minutes or less, or take 10,000 damage or less. You get a Heart Container for fi in the a rank and a heart piece for girahim for capturing the Southwest Keep.</p>

Heart Container (Zelda) - Capture the King's Hall. Heart Piece (Zelda) - Capture the Fairy Fountain. Defeat the three enemy captains marked on your map.

You're going to want to keep an eye on the Allied Base as there are a bunch of Dinolfos and Darknuts running around and they tend to make a beeline for your base. You'll also want to take out the Messengers (they call in reinforcements) and Siege Captains (they weaken keeps making them harder to capture and more likely to fall under enemy control) as soon as they appear on the map</p>

      <p>All attacks do a ton of damage including yours. First, equip your Bow and take out the few Deku Babas you'll find dotted around the battlefield. Now focus your attention on the enemy captains. One arrow from your Bow will take them out so you can always play it safe and shoot them from afar. Just make sure you keep moving so you don't get smacked by one of the grunts.</p>

      <p>Use the Ice Arrow Card on the circle of fire to unlock the "A" Rank reward. Heart Container (Ganondorf) - "A" Rank reward.</p>
      <p>Three rooms, three sets of enemies. Before you enter each room, cut up the patches of grass and maybe you'll be lucky enough to fill your Magic or Special meters. Also, each room contains two Beamos so take them out with your Bombs as soon as you enter each room.</p>
      <p>In the first room you'll face The Imprisoned and two Mini-The Imprisoned. Focus on taking out the minis first but keep your eye on the big guy. When you see red electricity litter the floor, get as far away from the big guy as possible to avoid a lightning attack. This can be tough, especially when he stands in the middle of the room so as soon as you fill up your Special Meter (if you were lucky with the grass outside, it will be full when you enter) hit the large Imprisoned with your Special Attack. This will knock him over. Hammer on him to reduce his Weak Point gauge. When he recovers, he'll chase you around a bit and hopefully end up somewhere other than dead center. Now take care of the minis while keeping an eye on the big guy. They reveal their Weak Point gauges after pulsing ripples of red energy or firing a purple beam from their mouths. Once both minis are gone, take out the big guy. In the second room you'll face two Dinolfos and two Shield Moblins. The Dinolfos are faster so they're easier to lure away from the group and fight separately. Once they're gone, take out the Moblins. In the third room you'll face Lana, Ruto and a Fiery Aeralfos. One strategy is to circle strafe around the enemies until one reveals its Weak Point gauge then run in and smash them!</p>

      <p>Use the Goddess's Harp Card on the butterflies to unlock the stage for play and use the Bomb Card on the north wall to unlock the "A" Rank reward. Megaton Hammer (most powerful version of Darunia's Hammer weapon) - "A" Rank reward. Heart Container (Darunia) - Capture the East Garden. Heart Piece (Darunia) - Capture the Southeast Keep.</p>
      <p>There's a trick to this one. As soon as the scenario starts, hightail it down to the West Garden and capture it as fast as you can. Once you do, pick up the Fairy of Lightning and run over to East Garden and capture that. Now book it up to the Northeast Keep, use the Fairy of Lightning to dispel the barrier and capture the keep. Quickly run to the Central Chamber and capture it. If you were fast enough, none of them should have fallen.</p>
      <p>By now, Zelda should be near the Allied Base. KO her and any Shield Moblins in the area. Once the Allied Base is safe, run to the Enemy Base and take out Link. If you're going for "A" Rank, don't stop to pad your KO numbers. There is a humongous supply of minions in the Enemy Base to take out while fighting Link.</p>
